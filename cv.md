## About Me
I have too many hobbies: programming, electronics, music, video games, video editing, design. Thanks to my hobbies, I was able to get a job as a content manager in an online electronics store, create a YouTube channel and be a welcome guest with a guitar at company corporate events. But programming is best for me, and in my current job, from a regular content manager, I was also able to become a programmer by making dozens of local software products to control the accounting of goods, orders, market analytics, etc. Due to the fact that all my applications i did it myself - my code is not well optimized and has rookie errors. My goal is to become a full-fledged back-end developer. I hope studying at RS School on the FE Pre-School course will help me fill in all the gaps in the initial knowledge of application development.
